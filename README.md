# Fur-Get-Me-Not-Pet-Adoptions

### Synopsis:

Fur-Get-Me-Not-Pet-Adoptions is an app designed to highlight shelter cats and dogs that have been waiting for lengthy periods to be adopted, and therefore urgently need a home. Our goal is to draw attention to these animals, as they are frequently overshadowed by younger, healthier ones. They may be adults or seniors, strays, animals coming from high-stress environments and/or disabled, injured or sick. But that just means they need us even more! We belive that every person needs a snuggle buddy, and who better than a sweet, furry friend who desperately needs some comfort and love!
