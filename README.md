# Fur-Get-Me-Not-Pet-Adoptions

### Synopsis:

Fur-Get-Me-Not-Pet-Adoptions is an app designed to highlight shelter cats and dogs that have been waiting for lengthy periods to be adopted, and therefore urgently need a home. Our goal is to draw attention to these animals, as they are frequently overshadowed by younger, healthier ones. They may be adults or seniors, strays, animals coming from high-stress environments and/or disabled, injured or sick. But that just means they need us even more! 

We created our app by combining the Petfinder API with Google's Geocoding and Javascript APIs to help user's find their purrfect match in their area. First we pulled all results from Petfinder. Next, we used our Google Maps APIs to narrow our search by location and return pets based on the user's zipcode, animal type and gender preferences, and then most importantly by oldest record. To develop our theme, we combined elements from both Bootstrap and Materialize and selected striking and inspiring images from Pexels. Finally, animations and modals were incorporated to make our app more dynamic.
